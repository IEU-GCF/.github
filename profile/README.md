# Independent Evaluation Unit – Green Climate Fund DataLab

Welcome to the **IEU DataLab**!  
We are the analytics and data science team within the Independent Evaluation Unit of the Green Climate Fund, dedicated to collecting and analyzing evidence that drives rigorous, policy-relevant evaluations of GCF's climate finance portfolio.

## 🎯 Our Mission & Accomplishments

The IEU DataLab collects and analyzes evidence to support IEU's independent evaluations, transforming complex data into actionable policy recommendations through innovative analytical approaches.

### What We've Delivered
Over the past years, our team has successfully supported multiple high-impact evaluations including:
- [Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) regional evaluation](#)
- [Indigenous Peoples evaluation](#)
- [Country Ownership assessment](#)
- [Simplified Approval Process (SAP) evaluation](#)
- [Country-level Impact Evaluation Workshops (CIEWs)](#)
- [Monitoring & Evaluation systems strengthening (upcoming)](#)

  In addition to evaluations, we also develop tools that enable large-scale data processing.

🔧 Special thanks to [@Agcaro]((https://github.com/Agcaro)) for developing automated text extraction scripts  
that identify and extract specific sections from funding proposals across the entire GCF portfolio.
